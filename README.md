# Interaction of climate change and forest fragmentation effects on population trends in forest breeding birds

This project explores the environmental context dependence of bird breeding population trends in the United States and Canada using the North American Breeding Bird Survey.

`/climate` contains scripts for calculating trends in breeding season minimum and maximum temperature at BBS routes using Daymet climate data

`/figures` contains all figure outputs from scripts

`/landcover-finescale` contains scripts for obtaining FRAGSTATS land cover measurements at 5-km buffers around BBS routes in the US and Canada.
The scripts in this folder were run on the University of North Carolina's Longleaf HPC.

`/model` contains data cleaning scripts and scripts for the main analyses of the project and manuscript figures.

`/traits` contains scripts for calculating ecological traits of the 67 forest breeding bird species in this analysis, including climatic niche breadth and habitat niche breadth.
